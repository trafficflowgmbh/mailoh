# Changelog

All notable changes to the mailoh desktop apps are recorded here.

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Dates are the dates the work actually landed; every entry corresponds to commits
you can read in `git log`.

A note on what a version means here: **0.x is a preview of the interface.** It
does not connect to a mailbox. See [Status](README.md#status--read-this-first).

## [Unreleased]

Next is the engine slice — IMAP behind today's `AppState` seam. See
[Roadmap](README.md#roadmap).

## [0.1.0-preview] — 2026-07-30

The first tagged build. Three platforms, one interface, a fictional mailbox, and
no network in any of them.

### Added

- **mailoh for macOS** — a native SwiftUI client. Every surface: Ohbox, Screener
  (two-pane, decision bar, bulk undo), Reads with its waterline, Receipts,
  triage piles with the Reply Run, tags, search, compose, settings. Light and
  dark, down to a 390 pt window, keyboard-first with a ⌘K palette. Ships with 99
  tests and a `--smoke` render check that hosts every route offscreen and fails
  if anything draws nothing. (2026-07-30)
- **mailoh for Windows and Linux** — a Tauri v2 shell rendering the same
  interface, built by Vite from the shared React shell rather than forked. The
  webview is locked down: `"permissions": []`, `withGlobalTauri` off,
  `assetProtocol` disabled, no `invoke_handler`, no plugins, and a CSP of
  `connect-src 'none'`. `offline-guard.ts` replaces fetch, XHR, WebSocket,
  EventSource and sendBeacon with functions that throw, so "no network" is
  testable rather than merely claimed. (2026-07-30)
- **The design system** — `@mailoh/tokens` (colour, type, spacing, radii,
  shadows, motion, z, in light and dark), `@mailoh/ui` (34 components, 2 hooks)
  and `@mailoh/fixtures` (the demo mailbox everything renders). The tokens carry
  an anti-drift gate: a test parses the canonical design prototype and fails on
  any divergence. Every colour, radius and layout value in the SwiftUI theme is
  then compared numerically against `packages/tokens/src/tokens.ts`, so the two
  clients cannot drift apart either. (2026-07-29)
- **`@mailoh/client-engine`** — the delta-sync core the shell runs on: an
  idempotent apply core, an IndexedDB mirror that writes page and cursor in one
  transaction, selectors, local search, and an optimistic overlay in which the
  user always wins. In this repository it runs against `FixturesAdapter`, a
  complete in-memory server. (2026-07-30)
- **The "oh." icon system** — one master mark in three optical tiers, so it stays
  legible from 16 px to 1024 px. `Resources/MailOh.icns` is the macOS bundle
  icon; the Tauri shell carries the same mark. (2026-07-30)
- **CI that builds what you download** — GitHub Actions produces a `.dmg` and a
  zipped `.app` on macOS 15, `.msi` and NSIS `-setup.exe` on Windows, and
  `.AppImage` and `.deb` on Linux, on every push. Each run prints the toolchain
  it used and the artifact's sha256, so an unsigned download can be checked
  against the run that made it. (2026-07-30)
- **The repository's own paperwork** — GPL-3.0 with a COPYRIGHT statement that
  says what it covers, TRADEMARK.md for the one thing the licence does not carry
  (the "oh." mark and the icon family), CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and screenshots
  taken by the app's own `--shot` mode. (2026-07-30)

### Changed

- The repository is `trafficflowgmbh/mailoh`. It was `mailoh-desktop` while the
  macOS app was the only thing in it; the Windows and Linux shells made that name
  narrower than the contents. The Rust crate was renamed with it. Nothing shipped
  changed: the binaries are still `mailoh` / `mailoh.exe`, and the `.deb` still
  installs `usr/bin/mailoh`. (2026-07-30)
- The demo mailbox is entirely fictional — no real people, no real brands, no
  real domains — and every name in it was cleared before use and recorded in a
  registry that CI greps. (2026-07-29 – 2026-07-30)
- Mail is never collapsed. "N more" placeholders were removed everywhere and held
  Screener mail became a structural array, so every held message renders in full
  and a Screener decision carries all of it. This is a product rule, and the
  guards on it are mutation-tested. (2026-07-30)

### Fixed

- **The Windows installers no longer download WebView2.** Tauri's default
  `webviewInstallMode` had put a WiX custom action in the `.msi` that ran a hidden
  `powershell.exe` against `go.microsoft.com`, and shipped `NSISdl.dll` in the
  `-setup.exe` for the same purpose — an outbound connection made by a product
  that says it cannot make one. Now `"type": "skip"`, and CI greps the built
  installers for all five signatures so it cannot come back. The honest cost is
  documented: the installers do not provide WebView2, which Windows 11 and any
  updated Windows 10 already have. (2026-07-30)
- The `.deb`'s package name is `mail-oh`, not `mailoh` — Tauri kebab-cases it out
  of `productName` and gives no way to override it. `apt remove mail-oh` is the
  command. Pinned in CI so the documentation goes red rather than stale.
  (2026-07-30)
- The Linux `.deb` inspection in CI anchored its assertions on a leading `/`,
  which `dpkg-deb -c` never prints, so three checks could never have matched.
  (2026-07-30)
- TRADEMARK.md claimed the icon files were the only binary artwork here, which
  contradicted COPYRIGHT two files away, and pointed forkers at a path that does
  not exist in this tree. (2026-07-30)
- Both READMEs overstated the `strings` audit of the release binaries. They now
  enumerate all 13 strings on Linux and 14 on Windows, including the four that
  are not URLs at all, and CI pins the counts. (2026-07-30)
- `ThemeProvider` no longer mismatches on hydration: a deterministic first
  render, then post-mount adoption that never clobbers the pre-paint stamp.
  (2026-07-30)

### Security

- No IMAP client, no HTTP client, no telemetry and no update check exists in
  either build. On macOS the entire app imports AppKit, Foundation, SwiftUI and
  Observation, and nothing else. On Windows and Linux the network APIs are
  removed from the page and the webview forbids connections outright.
- Nothing is signed on any platform. See the install notes in the README —
  Gatekeeper, SmartScreen and the AppImage's executable bit all need a manual
  step, and that is a real cost of a preview rather than something to gloss over.
