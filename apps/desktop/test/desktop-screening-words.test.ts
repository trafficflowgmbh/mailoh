/**
 * "WHAT REACHES YOUR OHBOX" — the pane, mounted, on each door and each way the engine can answer.
 *
 * `desktop-shell.test.ts` asserts what this file's SOURCE says: that the control is the shared one
 * and the transport is the bridge. That is a structural claim and it cannot see the two things a
 * person actually experiences — whether the section appears at all, and what it says when it does.
 * Both of those have been wrong here in ways a source assertion was blind to:
 *
 *  · the section was drawn on ONE door and the reason recorded for withholding it on the other was
 *    about a control in a different application, which this window cannot render;
 *  · the sentence under the heading described one of the two places the words go, because the
 *    other was not wired — a narrowing that had to be undone in lockstep with the wiring, and
 *    nothing but a rendering test can hold the two together.
 *
 * So this file drives it: a stand-in shell answers `engine_request` in the shell's own encoding,
 * and every case below asserts what is on screen.
